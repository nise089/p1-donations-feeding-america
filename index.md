# Research Project: Pro-Social Behavior  


You are on the project website of the research project "Pro-Social Behavior and the influence of the Welfare State". The study is a research project by the University of Regensburg (Germany) conducted by the researcher Denise Huber, M.A.. 

If you are a participant of my study on Prolific: Thank you for participation!
If you are generally interested in my study: Thank you for your interest!


On this website, I provide you with information and some results on the project.

## Aim of the Study
This study aims to investegate if individuals of societies with strong social welfare states behave less pro-socially when authorities do not interveen. 

## Set Up
The study was conducted with two samples (Swedes and US-Americans participants). 
There are two treatments: AUTHORITY and BASE. 
Participants of both samples are randomly assigned to one of the two treatments. 

In **AUTHORITY**, there are two roles, Decision Maker and Committee Member, and two stages, the decision and regulation stages.

- *Decision stage*: The Decision Maker chooses option A or B. When selecting B, the Decision Maker received a higher payoff than when choosing A. However, the decision also affects a donation pot initially filled with donations. B reduces the donations to 0, while A preserves the donations. For the Swedish sample, the beneficiary charity was "Cancerfonden". For the US-American sample, it was "Feeding America".

- *Regulation stage*: Before, three Committee Members can decide to regulate the available options of the Decision Maker in the decision stage. First, each vote for one of the three actions: Ban option A, ban option B or do not regulate. Then, the action for which at least two Committee Members have voted is taken to action. Conditional on the Committee's choice, four situations may occur in the decision stage. First, if the majority voted to ban option A (B), the Decision Maker has to choose option B (A). If the majority voted not to regulate, the Decision Maker could choose between A and B. Finally, if no majority was found, the Decision Maker can choose between A and B. Decision Makers make their decision in all four situations in random order. At the end of the experiment, each Decision Maker is matched with three randomly selected Committee Members whose votes determine the payoff-relevant situation. 

In **BASE**, there is only the role of the Decision Maker. It consists only of the decision stage without a Committee that could have regulated the available option. The Decision Maker chooses between options A and B, which have the same consequences on the Decision Maker's payoff and the donations as in AUTHORITY.


## Final Donations

Overall **£XXXX donations** were generated within the experiment. Thereof £XXXX ($XXX) were donated to [Feeding America](feedingamerica.org) and £XXXX (XXX kr) were donated to [Cancerfonden](Cancerfonden.se).

## Some Experimental Results

**Vote distribution of Committee Members**

|  	 na		| 	SWE 			| 	USA 			|
|-----------------------|:--------------------------------:|-------------------------------|
|	N		| 39 				| 	39 			|
| % voted for ban A	 | 15.4 			|	20.5 			|
| % voted for ban B 	| 43.6 	   			|	46.1 			|
| % voted for no regulation | 0.41 			|	33.3 			|

**Choice of Decision Makers in BASE and AUTHORITY treatment**

In the Authority treatment the choice of Decision Makers in the situation of no regulation by majoritiy voting is reported.

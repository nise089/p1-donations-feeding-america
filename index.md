# Research Project: Pro-Social Behavior  


You are on the project website of the research project "Pro-Social Behavior and the influence of the Welfare State". The study is a research project by the University of Regensburg (Germany conducted by the researcher Denise Huber, M.A.. 

If you are a participant of my study on Prolific: Thank you for participation in the study!
If you are generally interested in my study: Thank you for your interest in the study!


On this website, I provide you with information and some results on the project.

## Aim of the Study
Previous evidence has shown significant differences in the social welfare regimes as well as actual pro-social behavior in highly liberal compared to highly egalitarian countries. In this study, I aim to investegate whether the social welfare regime individuals are socialised in affects the level (government/ state authorities or individuals) at which they allocate responsibility for social welfare issues. 

## Hypotheses
Individuals of strong social welfare states (like in Sweden) associtate responsibility for social welfare issues stronger with a regulatory authority than individuals of a weak social welfare state (like in the US).
When there is an inactive regulatory authority (meaning it does not regulate choices), Swedish individuals behave less pro-social than their underlying preference suggests, while US-Americans do not change behavior.

## Set Up
The study was conducted with two sample (Swedes and US-Americans participants). 
There were two treatments: BASE and AUTHORITY. 
In each treatment one participant was assigned to the role Decision Maker. The Decision Maker could choose between the pro-social option A or the non-pro-social option B. When B was chosen, the particpant recieved a higher payoff than when A was chosen. However, the choice of B reduced the money in the donation pot to 0, while with A there is no reduction in the donations.
For the Swedish sample the benefitary charity was "Cancerfonden". For the US-American sample it was "Feeding America".
In BASE, the Decision Maker just made their choice between A and B.
In AUTHORITY, a group of three other participants (Committee Members) could decide whether to restrict the Decision Maker's choice or not. Each Committee Member voted for one of the three actions: Ban option A, ban option B, do not regulate. If at least two Committee Members voted to ban A (B), the Decision Maker had to choose B (A). If the majority voted not to regualte or no majority was reached, the Decison Maker could freely choose between A or B. Committee Members and Decision Makers were matched only within samples. 


## Final Donations

Overall **£XXXX donations** were generated within the experiment. Thereof £XXXX ($XXX) were donated to [Feeding America](feedingamerica.org) and £XXXX (XXX kr) were donated to [Cancerfonden](Cancerfonden.se).
